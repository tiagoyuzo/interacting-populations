# interacting-populations
Matlab code to simulate the effects of toxicity in two competing species, in hypothetical settings.

This code does not receive maintenance, use at own risk.

The methods used are:
- Finite element method;
- Finite difference (Crank-Nicolson) method;
- Predictor-corrector method for successive linearization in time stepping

This code was used for my master dissertation (in Portuguese), available online at http://repositorio.unicamp.br/handle/REPOSIP/307267?mode=full
